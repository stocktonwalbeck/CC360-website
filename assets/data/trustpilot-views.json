    "text": "I am not new at marketing and business. I started my first company when I was 22, Dropped out of college moved to Seattle And start from nothing. I've had several companies through my life. I am now 63 years old. The online marketing is a new turn for me. But all the business principles I have learned throughout my life still apply. I have course creator 360 and course creator pro. I wish that I had found them earlier Because I have spent 100 thousand  dollars Working with another coach company That has turned out to be smoke and mirrors. the wisdom and support I get from Stockton well back is second to none. the community is outstanding and their willingness to share and give feedback. they are saving me thousands of dollars per month by eliminating software stacking, and having everything integrated makes everything run seamlessly. One of the things I truly love about dealing with Stockton and course created 360 is they are on top of Everything that is coming out and teaching on how to utilize it. what I am learning and implementing into my company as far as artificial intelligence goes has truly revolutionized our whole process of business. Stockton and the course creator 360 Team have been The key to learning The ai process. I cannot Express how valuable my experience has been. if you are looking to run a business in today's economy and world of digital everything, you would be foolish not to sign up For a 30 day free trial an experience the learning and support you would get. I wish you well in your entrepreneurial adventures and hope you make the right choice to move forward and try course creator 360 for yourself. Phil Lerdahl",

Right before I'm launching my course I discovered Course Creator 360... within the past 48 hours they have gotten me on board they have done all the technology for me and the templates are so intuitive. I have gotten emails and texts with support and I also had a question that I clicked on chat and I didn't understand the response so the representative sent me a loom video showing how to do it within my own account! I am blown away by the customer service and I finally feel like the platform I'm using has support to help me succeed.",

Now that would be great on its own, but the support is super awesome. A couple days ago I had a walk-through demo that was great. LOL when you sign up they kinda pester you do an onboarding call and now I see why. I just got done with mine. Juan Ossa setup all my domains, emails, and answered my questions. I have a web development background so I *could* have done the setup myself, but it's soooo much faster and easier when someone just handles it for you. DONE and done. Now I'm ready to get to work. So far CC360 seems to be like a great investment for me. I am one happy camper.",

This platform is a true all-in-one solution that solved all my course-hosting headaches.Instead of piecing together a million different tools, CC360 allows me to host my course content directly on their platform, create effective sales funnels, and even manage my clients through their built-in CRM.But that's not all. CC360 also has powerful automation features and email campaign capabilities, allowing me to nurture leads, engage with my students, and streamline my entire online course business.Seriously, this platform does it all! From course delivery to marketing, CC360 has streamlined the process for me, saving me from learning countless other tools.If you're a course creator feeling lost in the sea of tech options, look no further. CC360 is the answer. It's user-friendly, powerful, and gives you everything you need to launch, manage, and grow your online course business in one place. Highly recommended!",

I have used it almost daily, and the help has been stellar. While I have chatted with a few folks, Nora in particular has been a life saver. She is always patient and incredibly informative. This is key, especially with someone new to the platform. I said this to her, and I will write it here. If I do fully commit to coming on board, it will have a good deal to do with the support she has offered over the past couple of weeks. When it comes to platforms like this, I really think they are only as good as the support you receive, and by that measure this platform should absolutely be tried out!",

Stockton, you‚Äôre the man. I‚Äôm at your service for life. No one will ever be able to repay you for what you‚Äôve done for your students.Your system of teaching‚Äîthe clarity, dedication, and personal attention‚Äîis worth 10x what I paid. To be mathematically correct, I‚Äôve made back in one week of using my card 227 times the amount in USD that I invested for one week of the CCP360 cost. When you look at those numbers, it‚Äôs just unbelievable.Haha, I‚Äôm laughing as I type this. It‚Äôs crazy how I was living before. I ran a notable team in China, trained and developed some of the brightest careers in the acting and action world there, and opened my own studio. I put all my life savings into it and went into debt when COVID hit and business dropped. Many of my friends and team members betrayed me when things got tough.Life wasn‚Äôt looking as good as it should‚Äôve been. But you gave me a way out of a depressing black hole of debt and failure. Life isn‚Äôt always fair, but you gave me the tools and ammunition to take my business back to where it belongs‚Äîat the forefront. I had many strategies to fix my poor fortune, but when I learned of Stockton and Course Creator 360, I watched his content and saw something in him that reminded me of my martial arts master who changed my life.I saw the truth, and I chose to follow that light, just like a ship follows a lighthouse‚Äîguided by his expertise, his care, his attention, and his zero tolerance for time-wasting BS. Stockton taught me how to make more money faster than I ever could directing a feature film.I‚Äôve shot commercials for Toyota, DJI, and worked on some of the highest-grossing films of all time. But I‚Äôve never made money faster or as honestly as I have when my students click the ‚Äúenroll now‚Äù button‚Äîa button that exists only because Stockton doesn‚Äôt quit.He possesses what I teach my students‚Äî‚ÄòLimitless mental courage.‚ÄôI‚Äôve been waiting my whole life to find a teacher and mentor like you, Stockton. The honor is mine, sir. For the rest of my days, wherever I am, whatever I may be doing, I stand a little different now, and I do so with some of you in my stance.God bless you. It‚Äôs not even about the money. I don‚Äôt give a shit about the money. I chose to follow you because I chose to believe in you. All I care about is working with good men, strong men, honest men.To me, you are worth more money than I could ever make from learning from you, sir.It‚Äôs been a privilege and an honour. I will work my ASS off to make you proud.To whom it may concern, here this and hear it loud:All I did was listen to Stockton and follow his course on how to create a course called 'Course Creator Pro'. I did exactly as he teaches. I took all the knowledge I‚Äôd given my team members for FREE for years while making TONNES of money for them‚Äîand turned it into a course.Now it‚Äôs selling at 997 USD, and the people who‚Äôve paid the full price are telling me I‚Äôm stupid because it‚Äôs worth over 5k-8k USD. They say I need to raise the price‚Ä¶ I nearly gave it away for 300 USD.To validate the efficacy of this Trustpilot review, you can find my course at troysteamonline, powered by Course Creator 360‚Äîthe best and most affordable online course software available.The year is 2025. From this point on, my life will never be the same.Stand by to get some.God bless Stockton and his excellent team under Course Creator 360.",

The CC360 platform has EVERYTHING I need, all under one roof, and without the need to cobble together a framework from \"zaps-n-apps\" that constantly break and don't work.But wait .... there's more!The only thing better than the CC360 platform is the entire CC360 customer support team.  From the best of cutting-edge AI technology that's immediately available 24/7, to the best hands-on technicians, I've always received dedicated support within three minutes.Further, the amazing culture that Stockton Walbeck has infused into this team is as contagious as it is rewarding.  These guys n gals know exactly what they're doing, and how to fix everything.So if you want the perfect, all-around platform from which to host your course, product, or community - stop torturing yourself and sign up with CC360, I promise that you will not regret it!",

Well CC360 changed that!! As soon as I opened the software and looked around, I couldn't believe everything that I needed was in one place. I always had to piece together multiple types of software to manage my business. No more!! I jumped on the demo with Jack, who was super nice and helpful. He listened to my concerns and showed me that they even have training, support, website building and landing page building done for you, templates, funnels and more!!

I was initially led to believe that this would be no problem at all, everything was possible and would be done in just 7-10 days...well here I am 7 weeks later and I've given up on the 'not-done-very-well-for-you migration' and hired a competent freelancer to finish the job off.My experience has been super frustrating. I was let down time and time again in terms of quality, reliability, and communication. There were no processes in place whatsoever, no clear roadmap, a lack of professionalism and skills - and as a result plenty of targets were missed and mistakes made.Worst of all though was the amount of time I ended up having to spend on it...I was left to basically manage the project, communicating with a 'team' of people  who were incredibly unprofessional and lacked skills too.I wanted to discuss my experience and offered to provide feedback to Stockton as a courtesy before posting this review. Expecting any business owner to show an interest in learning and improving, I was met instead with a very inflexible schedule and no real willingness to make use of this offer. It seems to me he doesn't really care, and just palms the migrations off to a 2nd rate team of freelancers who have no processes to follow, very little knowledge and training in the tasks they need to do, and terrible customer service (besides saying sorry a lot, which doesn't count for much after a while).As excited as I was about this service at the start of this process I honestly cannot recommend the ‚ÄòDone for you migration service‚Äô on offer here. If you have an existing online course business running on other software and think it will be an easy move across to CC360 with the 'done for you migration' ...think again...it was an absolute shambles!",
